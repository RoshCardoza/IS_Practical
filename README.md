A disease such as cancer is often a dramatic experience in life. Therefore, the first contact between patient and physician is particularly important. In a conversation between patient and physician, called anamnesis or patient history taking, the physician gets a first impression and might already take first decisions for the following diagnostic process. Consequently, the dialogue for the anamnesis is of crucial importance. To professionalize the communication between patient and physician is an essential task we are exploring by using cutting-edge technology to reshape patient-physician communication through a unique serious game approach.

In this game, two configurations shall be tested: either two players are representing patient and physician (role-taking of the two roles) or there is only one player who takes on the role of the patient while the other counterpart is the chatbot. To obscure whether there is a chatbot or a real person on the other side in the role of the physician, the patient sees only text resp. synthetic audio. In the case of the chatbot, the text of the predefined questions asked to the patient are converted into audio whereas for a real patient, the voice is converted first into text and then synthesized back into audio.
